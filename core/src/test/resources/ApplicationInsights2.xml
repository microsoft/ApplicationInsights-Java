		In code, BuiltIn TelemetryProcessors are annotated with @BuiltInProcessor.
		This section can be used to load and configure these processors.
		By default, none of these are loaded.
		
		Both the BuiltInProcessors and CustomProcessors have the same child structure.
		In each section, 'Processor' elements can be added with a required 'type' attribute specifying the FQCN of the TelemetryProcessor implementation.
		This enables that processor and the child elements of Processor configure that class.
		
		The 'Add' elements call setters in the TelemetryProcessor implementation.
		The implementation must have a setter defined matching the 'name' attribute.
		See examples below.
		
		There are two other configuration elements available: ExcludedTypes and IncludedTypes.
		These specify the Telemetry item types which should be handled by the TelemetryProcessor.
		The TelemetryProcessor implementation should include these methods respectively: 'addToExcludedType(String value)' and 'addToIncludedType(String value)'.
		Generally, a telemetry item will be processed if the item type is not in the ExcludedTypes and when the IncludedTypes set is non-empty, the item type is in the IncludedTypes.
		However, it is up to the TelemetryProcessor implementation to enforce this contract.
